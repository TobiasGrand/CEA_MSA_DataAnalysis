# CEA_MSA_DataAnalysis
This repository contains a Markdown report with a data analysis in multiple system atrophy intended for cost-effectiveness modelling. The report contains an analysis of EQ-5D and UMSARS Part IV data for calculation of mean index scores (utilities) stratified by UMARS Part IV. In addition, the UMSARS Part IV is used for calculation of transition probabilities using both non-parametric count methods and multistate modelling. 

The data is used in the Shiny app: https://sheffield-university.shinyapps.io/eHTA4MSA2025/, which is further described in the a publication titled: Clinical, economic, and quality-of-life burden of multiple system atrophy: cost-effectiveness modelling for early health technology assessment
